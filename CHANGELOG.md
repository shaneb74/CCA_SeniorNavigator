- Fixed Step 3 expander titles to show only labels (e.g., Income â€” Mom) without preview values, resolving display issues.
- Ensured all Step 3 drawers (Income, Benefits, Home, Assets) display correctly with proper field loading.
- Fixed Altair chart error in Step 4 by using pd.DataFrame for data input and handling infinite years with "Forever" fallback.
- Updated `APP_VERSION` to `v2025-09-03-rb23`.
- Retained all previous updates: yes/no buttons, home mods, sell-home logic, care level/context, mobility, chronic conditions, VA link in Benefits.
